# PC Registration System

This project is a PC Registration System implemented using a circular linked list. The system will utilize various searching and sorting algorithms to manage and retrieve data efficiently. Additionally, there is a plan to integrate the system with a database for persistent storage.

## Features

- **Circular Linked List**: The core data structure used for storing PC registration details.
- **Searching Algorithms**: Implementation of different searching algorithms to find specific PC registrations.
- **Sorting Algorithms**: Implementation of various sorting algorithms to organize the PC registrations.
- **Database Integration**: Future plan to integrate the system with a database for persistent storage.

## Requirements

- C++ Compiler
- Database (optional, for future integration)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the executable to start the PC Registration System.

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a database for persistent storage.
- Implementation of additional data structures and algorithms.
